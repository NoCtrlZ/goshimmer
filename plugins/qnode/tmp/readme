How to start goshimmer configuration for testing qnode.
This repo uses goshimmer in a very stripped down mode. Most of plugins are disabled.

the testing configuration consists of 4 goshimmer nodes, running on the same machine on
different directories with different config.json files.
See below how to set up config file for each instance
Those 4 nodes can be run by the start4.bat The directory in startgs.bat must be adjusted accordingly

When 4 nodes are running, it is possible:
to run following programs from tools directory:
- newassembly - It creates smart contract data record in each of goshimmer instances
- newdks - it creates distributed key shares and BLS addresses for testing. They are distributed among 4 instances/nodes
- newconfig - it creates specific configuration data of the committee with those secret shares

When assembly, keys and configurations are in the database of the goshimmer instances, we can run
PoC. In the current directory [..]\goshimmer\plugins\qnode\tools\mocknode run command:
mocknode mocknode.json
it starts value tangle emulator and web server for the FairRulette smart contract.
To access fair roulette PoC type in browser http://localhost:2000

How to set up config file for instance with number i:

Copy the file config.json to each of directories and the change some value in each of them:
Here i=0,1,2,3, the number of the instance (and peer index)

Set up individual port for web api in the section
"webapi"{
    "bindAddress": "127.0.0.1:909i"
}
(for instance 0 port will be 9090 and so on)

Set up qnode section:
"qnode": {
    "port": 400i,
    "mockPubTxPort": 300i,
    "mockTangleIpAddr": "127.0.0.1",
    "mockTanglePort": 7000
  }

Ports 400i  will be used for messaging, ports 300i will be used for connection with the tangle emulator
